            <b> MAYOR OF MARIKINA (1992-2001)</b>
            <br>
            Fernando first ran for mayor of the municipality of Marikina in 1988, finishing in fourth place among seven candidates. In 1992, he was elected mayor of Marikina. His administration
             as mayor transformed the former municipality into one of the best-managed cities and a paradigm of responsive and effective governance. His term saw the transformation of Marikina from 
             a 4th class municipality to a model Philippine city accorded with 55 citations and distinctions. He was re-elected mayor twice, serving until 2001. He was succeeded by his wife, 
             Marides Fernando.

            <br>
            <b>MMDA CHAIRMAN (2002-2009)</b>
            <br><br>
            In 2002, Fernando was appointed Chairman of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, directing him to duplicate his transformation work in 
            Marikina, but for the entire Metro Manila. He gained polarized public reactions to his strict style of governance.
            <br>
            Fernando briefly served as Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) from January 15, 2003, until April 15, 2003.
            <br>
            For his work as chairman, he was conferred the Doctor of Humanities, Honoris Causa, Ateneo de Cagayan, The Outstanding Filipino (TOFIL) Award for Government Service, 
            the H.R Reyes Academic Medallion of Honor, Central Colleges of the Philippines and Doctor of the Public Administration, Honoris Causa by the Polytechnic University of the Philippines.
